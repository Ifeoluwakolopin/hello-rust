# Guess The Number Game ðŸŽ®

This simple game allows a player to guess a randomly generated number within a given number of rounds.

The steps below allow you to download and run the source code on your local machine.

In future, I would provide a simple executable that will allow you **run the game without having to install rust on your machine**.
You can follow these steps if you wish to try out the game anyways, or contribute to the game. ThanksðŸ¤©

### Setup
This game is written in Rust, and therefore would need rust to run.
Follow these [steps](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html) to install and set up rust on your computer (Mac/Linux or Windows)

Run
`rustc --version` to check if you have succesfully installed rust.
Also run `cargo --version` to check if cargo was succesfully installed with Rust.<br/>
You will need cargo to run the game.
